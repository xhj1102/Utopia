# Utopia
An all-purpose government simulator.



 # Development Routine

Currently we're in the ED stage (not all function presents, but only a few). Next-step plans are:

- Stability Improvement
- Add load-save function and data management
- Allow users to set custom simulation rate



# Running

*Currently in the Early Development stage*:

```Bash
# Download required Libraries
pip install ticking

# Clong repository
git clone [Repository URL]

# Run the program
cd Utopia/
python utopia.py --help

# Usage: python utopia.py [--content-dir ./content/default] [--simulation-speed NORMAL] [--force-new-simulation true]
```
